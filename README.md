Knives Guns and Ghosts

If you are here from Stack Overflow and wonder why I instance stuff with code, here's why.
Players - I'm making the game multiplayer and will need to instance players as they join
Lights - I will have a script that looks for light emmitting objects on tile maps and instances and moves the lights accordingly, and the mask light needs to be last
Tilemaps - Will have different maps

Lighting has a known bug where the mask will not function properly on the first run. This is because it loaded in the wrong order. Change nothing and launch it again, it should work the second time.
